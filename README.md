This was a game I created for an English project in my sophomore year, It is based off of Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. It's gameplay was inspired by The Oregon Trail. The game sees you leading a party from Oklahoma to Califronia, while managing your gas, food, money, and health. The objective of the game is to reach Bakersfield, California. Made by Adrian Li
